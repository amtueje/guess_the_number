# Guess the Number Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic "Guess the Number" game. The goal of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of while loops in Python.

## Problem Statement
Create a simple "Guess The Number" game where the programme generates a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the user has to guess the number. 

The user gets an unlimited number of guesses and after each guess the programme should provide a hint, e.g. "too high" if the user's guess is greater than the target number of "too low" if the user's guess is lower than the target number. 

The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number.

Print the number of attempts it took the user to guess the correct number. 


## How to Play

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player's objective is to guess the number with as few attempts as possible. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/amtueje/guess-the-number.git
	```
2. Naviage to the project directory:

	```sh
	cd guess-the-number
	```
3. Run the game:
	```sh
	python guess_the_number.py
	```
